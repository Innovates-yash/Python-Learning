# 4. Data types in python

a = 45/5
print(type(a))  # This will print the data type of variable 'a'
# float data are number that are decimal point values or write p/q form
# b = 45//5

# complex  data type 
B = 3 + 5j
print(type(B))  # This will print the data type of variable 'B' of  complex type

# String data type
c = "Hello, Python!"

# String Indexing and slicing
print(c[0])      # prints 'H'
print(c[0:5])    # prints 'Hello'
# end indexing of slicing you have to take n-1 value and put +1 indexing number to get correct output
# output will be from 0 to 4 index value

# Output/Input in python
print("Hello python We are leaning and master it") # use print() function to print any data on screen
# use input() function to take input from user

name = input("Enter your name: ")  # takes input from user
print("Hello, " + name + "!")  # greets the user with their name
